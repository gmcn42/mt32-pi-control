You may specify multiple options, i.e. mt32-pi-ctl -m -t "Hello, World!" will
first send the MT-32 mode command and then the screen text.

### bash completion ####

Since version 1.0.1, the Linux version of mt32-pi-ctl also comes with an intelligent
bash completion script that will smartly autocomplete (long) options, romsets, filenames
and, if aplaymidi is in your PATH, even available MIDI ports.

Examples:

  $ mt32-pi-ctl -p <TAB><TAB>
    14:0  28:0

  $ mt32-pi-ctl -p 28:0 --mt<TAB><TAB>
    --mt32  --mt32-reset --mt32-rstereo --mt32-txt

  $ mt32-pi-ctl -p 28:0 --romset <TAB><TAB>
    cm32l  new  old

For this to work mt32-pi-ctl must be in your PATH, e.g. in /usr/local/bin and the bash
completion script must be in a special completion script directory or sourced by .bashrc.

On modern Debian/Ubuntu systems, install the script using

  # cp bash_completion/mt32-pi-ctl.bash /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/mt32-pi-ctl

On other or older distros it may need to go to /etc/bash_completion.d/mt32-pi-ctl instead.

Alternatively you can add the line

  source /path/to/mt32-pi-ctl.bash

to your .bashrc. After installing, you may need to relogin or reboot
