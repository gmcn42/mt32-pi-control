#### MT32-PI.TTP 1.0.1 Atari ST ReadMe ####

MT32-PI.TTP is a control program for the mt32-pi MIDI synthesizer.

Note that this is a CLI/TTP-utility. If you launch it directly from
TOS a graphical prompt will let you input the parameters. Though for
more convenience I would recommend a text based shell like EmuCON
or Okami.

Program source, build instructions and ports to different modern and
retro platforms available at https://github.com/gmcn42/mt32-pi-control

The mt32-pi synthesizer lives at https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi

first send the MT-32 mode command and then the screen text.
